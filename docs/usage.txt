django-mailer-2 is asynchronous so in addition to putting mail on the queue you
need to periodically tell it to clear the queue and actually send the mail.

The latter is done via a command extension.


Putting Mail On The Queue (Django 1.2 or higher)
=================================================

In settings.py, configure Django's EMAIL_BACKEND setting like so:

    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django_mailer.smtp_queue.EmailBackend'

If you don't need message priority support you can call send_mail like
you normally would in Django::

    send_mail(subject, message_body, settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL, recipients)

If you need prioritized messages, create an instance of EmailMessage
and specify {'X-Mail-Queue-Priority': '<value>'} in the ``headers`` parameter,
where <value> is one of:

    'now' - do not queue, send immediately
    'high' - high priority
    'normal' - standard priority - this is the default.
    'low' - low priority

If you don't specify a priority, the message is sent at 'normal' priority.


Putting Mail On The Queue (Django 1.1 or earlier)
=================================================

Because django-mailer currently uses the same function signature as Django's
core mail support you can do the following in your code::

    # favour django-mailer-2 but fall back to django.core.mail
    from django.conf import settings

    if "mailer" in settings.INSTALLED_APPS:
        from django_mailer import send_mail
    else:
        from django.core.mail import send_mail

and then just call send_mail like you normally would in Django::

    send_mail(subject, message_body, settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL, recipients)

Additionally you can send all the admins as specified in the ``ADMIN``
setting by calling::

    mail_admins(subject, message_body)

or all managers as defined in the ``MANAGERS`` setting by calling::

    mail_managers(subject, message_body)


Clear Queue With Command Extensions
===================================

With mailer in your INSTALLED_APPS, there will be two new manage.py commands
you can run:

 * ``send_mail`` will clear the current message queue. If there are any
   failures, they will be marked deferred and will not be attempted again by
   ``send_mail``.

 * ``retry_deferred`` will move any deferred mail back into the normal queue
   (so it will be attempted again on the next ``send_mail``).

You may want to set these up via cron to run regularly::

    * * * * * (cd $PROJECT; python manage.py send_mail >> $PROJECT/cron_mail.log 2>&1)
    0,20,40 * * * * (cd $PROJECT; python manage.py retry_deferred >> $PROJECT/cron_mail_deferred.log 2>&1)

This attempts to send mail every minute with a retry on failure every 20 minutes.

``manage.py send_mail`` uses a lock file in case clearing the queue takes
longer than the interval between calling ``manage.py send_mail``.

Note that if your project lives inside a virtualenv, you also have to execute
this command from the virtualenv. The same, naturally, applies also if you're
executing it with cron.
